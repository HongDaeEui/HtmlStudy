            Brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric are raised by their mother Trisha
            Elric in the remote village of Resembool in the country of Amestris.
            Their father Hohenheim, a noted and very gifted alchemist, abandoned
            his family while the boys were still young, and while in Trisha's
            care they began to show an affinity for alchemy and became curious
            about its secrets. However, when Trisha died of a lingering illness,
            they were cared for by their best friend Winry Rockbell and her
            grandmother Pinako. The boys traveled the world to advance their
            alchemic training under Izumi Curtis. Upon returning home, the two
            decide to try to bring their mother back to life with alchemy.
